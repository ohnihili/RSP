# RSP

## Project Overview:

Implementations of three basic datastructures, and algorithms relating to them, in C++. 
Includes: 
Linked List - With basic emplace, erase, and search methods.
Graph - With basic add vertex/edge, remove vertex/edge, and print methods.
Binary Tree - With basic emplace, erase, BFS, and DFS (all traversals).

## Instructions to Run the Code:
To test each datastructure simply use the makefile commands.

For each they are:
make run-list
make run-graph
make run-tree
